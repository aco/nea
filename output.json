      "Specifically the reward applies to foreign hackers who are found to be in violation of Section 1030, title 18 of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, which essentially criminalizes hackers gaining unauthorized access to computers.",
      "With less than four months to go until the presidential 2020 election, the US has decided to offer a $10 million bounty to anyone who can find foreign hackers trying to meddle in the election."

      "DeWine's first try at a statewide requirement for wearing masks inside businesses - back in April - drew backlash that led him to rescind that directive the following day, a stutter among the aggressive moves that had won him early praise in his efforts to curb the virus.",
      "DeWine, 73, a Republican, said he underwent a diagnostic screening for the coronavirus as part of a safety protocol ahead of an appearance he was scheduled to make with Trump before the president's visit to a Whirlpool Corp (WHR.N) washing-machine factory.",
      "A mild-mannered career politician, Mr. DeWine spent decades in public office -- as a county prosecutor, state senator, congressman, lieutenant governor, U.S. senator and state attorney general -- largely out of the national spotlight, until the pandemic turned him into something of a social media sensation."

      "Next week, the US plans to escalate its campaign by putting forward a UN security council resolution calling for an extension of an international arms embargo on Iran, with the threat that if the resolution is rejected, it will take a drastic and legally controversial step: claim to be still technically a participant in the JCPOA and use the terms of the deal to \"snap back\" UN sanctions on Iran.",
      "Mr. Pompeo gave Mr. Hook the Iran file on a full-time basis, a job he pursued doggedly, including when he personally emailed the captain of an Iranian tanker carrying oil to Syria in violation of U.S. sanctions, offering him millions of dollars in federal rewards if he piloted the ship into the hands of a U.S. ally.",
      "One of the few senior political appointees to remain at the State Department since the start of the Trump administration, Hook previously served as director of policy planning and was a trusted senior adviser to then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson."

      "Gerry Bell, the lead hurricane season forecaster with the climate prediction center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said there could be 19 to 25 named storms, those with sustained winds above 38 miles an hour, or 61 kilometers an hour, by the time the season ends on Nov. 30.",
      "Even though studies predict that a warmer world means generally stronger and wetter hurricanes, Emanuel and the NOAA's Bell said there are so many complicated factors in an individual season that they can't say either way whether man-made climate change is a factor in active years like 2020."
